This is the report and slide for the final project of **Selected Topics in Visual Recognition using Deep Learning**.In the project, we are given some chest X-ray radiographs and are asked to come up with a model to output pneumonia regions (bounding boxes) for each graph if they exist.In this **object detection** task,we try multiple models like **YOLOv5, RetinaNet** with Resnet50 and Resnet101 as backbones. Our best model is an ensemble model with two RetinaNet.

交大碩班課程基於深度學習之視覺辨識專論期末報告，我們嘗試了YOLOv5, RetinaNet with Resnet50 and Resnet101 as backbones等模型來完成胸部X光影像偵測肺炎的任務，最佳模型為兩個RetinaNet所組成的集成模型。
